		<p>Student at <a href="https://millersville.edu" target="_blank">Millersville University</a></p>

		<p>My name is Brecken MacDougall, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree at Millersville University. I am currently a sophomore, and I am majoring in Applied Engineering and Technology Management with a concentration in Computer-Aided Drafting and Design. I am also taking a minor in Computer Science. I am not sure what career I would like to pursue once I am done college, so I would like to explore possible future careers during my time at Millersville. I am currently a full-time student here at Millersville, and I live on campus in the South Village Dorms. I am currently a member of two clubs: Slip and Score Society, which is the ceramics club, and CHAARG, which is a women's exercise club.</p>
		<p>This website is an e-portfolio containing information about the projects that I have completed for the Communication and Information Systems course at Millersville University. This includes the print project, digital photography project, and infographic project.</p>
